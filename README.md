# Homework-Week-10

My page this weeks talks about the importance of RWD and how it would be applied in the changing of technology.
The first thing on the sight that should draw your eye is the main concept of the page, which is depicted in the center, an
image of diffirent computer sizes.
The primary content of the page is the deffinition of RWD and the importance of it use, the Secondary content is about 
wireframes and how important it is to start from a mobile type perspective and not a desktop perspective when
building a site.
I kept my site fairly simple, using content both from wikipidia and a article by Segue 3 Tech, adding a link to both 
websites for source information and full articles. The images I used were both sourced from searching both
RWD and Wireframe.
I can see the importance of using RWD and Wire Frame.  The compatabilty for RWD, and the lack of frustration
by sketching out your site before you start.
