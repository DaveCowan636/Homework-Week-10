          <center><strong> What is RWD or Responsive Web Design </center></strong>
            Responsive web design (RWD) is an approach to web design aimed at allowing desktop webpages to be viewed in response to the size of the screen or web browser one is viewing with. In addition it's important to understand that Responsive Web Design tasks include offering the same support to a variety of devices for a single website. Responsive web design has become more important as the amount of mobile traffic now accounts for more than half of total internet traffic.</br>

        <center><strong>Changing the Way We Do Wireframes</center></strong>
A wireframe is the skeleton of the page, usually drawn with basic shapes and lines with limited colors and styling. The point is to focus on figuring out layout and content placement, and solving navigation and functionality problems in a format that is easy to adjust. When planning for a responsive website design, we cannot continue to think through the wireframing process from a desktop only perspective. However, I understand that changing the way we think about these layouts and choosing a new direction can be a little challenging. For years we have spent our time designing fixed width layouts or maximum 960px width in our designs. Wireframing for mobile devices first (or from narrow widths outwards) helps us prioritize site elements while putting us in a good mindset for thinking about what content is most relevant to the site visitor and how your content becomes available to work with on wider screens.</br>

          <center><strong> Why is RWD Important</center></strong>
          RWD is important with all the changes we have had in technology, multiple devices, multiple screen sizes, and almost
          everyone being online in some way or another.  In order to keep up with the useres of these diffirent devices it is
          important that they can use and interact with your content.
